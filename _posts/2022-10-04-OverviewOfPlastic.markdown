# Overview of Plastic
Plastics, love it or hate it, we can't seem to live without it. Especially in the modern era, it is unavoidable. From our farming irritation systems, to our food packing, from the vehicles we drive in, to the houses we build, in our phones and the clothes we wear, it is everywhere. But what exactly is plastic? Where does it come from and how is it made?

## Overview
Plastics are a type of polymer. Polymers are defined as long chains of repeating units. Hence the Greek word of poly meaning many and "meros" meaning part. 

Plastics have become widely used due to several characteristic. Plastic is lightweight particular in comparison to it's competitors. Plastic is also easily moldable into countless shapes making it versatile. Finally it is both a electronic and thermos insulator. 

Plastics can be further broken down into synthetics and natural polymers. With synthetics, two main variants are thermoplastics and thermosets. These variants can take the structure of amorphous or semi-crystalline

## Plastics as a Polymers
Plastic is a polymer, but not all polymers are plastic. Polymers simply describe the long chain of repeating units or monomers. These are typically made up of the elements carbon and hydrogen, and also include others like oxygen, silicon, nitrogen, floured, phosphorus, sulfur, and chorine. It depends on the type of polymer. Polymers can be broken down into two categories of natural and synthetic or man made. 

## Natural and Synthetic Polymers
Natural polymers are naturally occurring in nature. These include natural rubber, amber, and cellulose but also DNA, RNA, proteins, and carbohydrates. Natural rubber is found in trees. Cellulose is a organic compound often found in trees, plants, and leaves. A commonplace cellulose is cotton from the cotton plant. Natural polymers are a core part of life and has been throughout history. 

Synthetic polymers have only been discovered around 100 years ago. The variants of synthetic are wide but can be categories with two main types thermosets and thermoplastics

## Thermosets
Polymers that have cross links are known as thermosets. This means that a bond forms between polymer chains, linking one to another. These bonds are formed during the curing process of the polymer. Once the process is complete, the plastic is no longer able to be reshaped. 

Therefore thermosets, once cured, are resistant to heat and reshaping. This property allows thermosets to be useful in protective coatings, linings, sealants, and insulators. 

However due to their resistance to be remolded, they are difficult to recycle.

## Thermoplastics
### Amorphous
The molecule chains for amorphous plastics are disorganized and intertwined. Due to this variance in structure, the bonds break at different temperatures. Thus when amorphous plastic is heated, it will move gradually from a harden state into a softer state. In addition, because of it's isotropic nature, it results in minimal shrinkage, making it a good choice for injection molding. Amorphous polymers tend to be translucent in nature. 

### Semi Crystalline
Semi Crystalline polymers have a densely organized pack of molecules chains. The crystalline areas vary in shape and size and there still can be amorphous areas present between crystalline areas. Distinct from amorphous plastic, semi crystalline hardens at a specific temperature. Semi Crystalline are resistant to chemicals. They also are characterized by being strong and stiff.

## Conclusion
Whether we like it or not, plastics are here to stay with us. By gaining a basic understanding of plastic, we are better equipped to handle discussions around plastics. We can understand some of the environmental concerns around plastics and how different plastics may need different solutions. Going forward, we can choose plastics that cause less damages to the environment. .
