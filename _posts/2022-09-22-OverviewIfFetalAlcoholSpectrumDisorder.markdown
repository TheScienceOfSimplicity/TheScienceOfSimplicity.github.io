# Overview of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD)

Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is caused by a women drinking during pregnancy. The alcohol enters the bloodstream and crosses the placenta, through the umbilical cord and enters the bloodstream of the child. The alcohol is metabolized by the child at a slower rate and thus the child is intoxicated for longer than the mother. It is believed that the neutron in the brain are being killed by alcohol and unable to grow or develop afterwards. The child's liver does not contain enzymes to break down alcohol.

It is more prevalence than previously believed and estimates say around 1-5% of US population has FASD.

In children with FASD, they have damage to the corpus callosum agenesis which can result in seizures or trouble learning. Also the cerebellum might be damaged causing issues with movement. Hippocampus might result in trouble learning. 

Physical characteristics of FASD, below 10th percent for height and weight. Some facial characteristic include smooth philtrum, thin vermilion and short palpebral and fissure length. These characteristic differences increase in intensity corresponding the to damage done.

The effects are both visual and cognitive. Children with this disorder might have smaller wider set eyes, a flat philtrum, thin upper lips and a short and upturned nose. It's also possible to have deformities. The cognitive effects include lower IQ, issues with reasoning and decision making, and overall downstream effects of brain damage.  Most commonly the effects are cognitive, sometimes manifesting in the inability to understand the abstract. More severe cases may be physical.

There is no cure for this disorder. Treatment mainly consists of behavior training. 

This is a 100% preventable disorder
