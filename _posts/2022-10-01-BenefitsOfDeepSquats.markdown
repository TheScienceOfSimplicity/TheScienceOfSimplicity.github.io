# Benefits of deep squat


The benefits of the primal squat are almost a cascading effect of improving the wellbeing of the body, inside and out.
One major component is increasing the mobility of the lower posterior chain, including the ankles, knees, and hips.

In a deep squat you are exercising your ankle dorsiflexion. Dorsiflexion is when the foot and shin and brought closer together. Greater dorsiflexion range of motion, typically the goal is around 20 degrees, has been found to reduce injuries such as Achilles tendinopathies. Deep squatting is a way of ensuring you have proper dorsiflexion mobility but also through repetition, maintain ankle mobility.

Deep squats are also helpful for knee mobility. There are some who discourage deep squats due to knee pain. If getting into a deep squat causes intense knee pain, it may not be the right exercise for your current stage of fitness. However that does not mean you cannot work into it. Over time, through building up mobility, flexibility and strength, one should be able to work into getting into a deep squat position. Like the ankles, repeated squats will ensure the knees are strong, flexible and mobile.

Getting into and maintaining a deep squat also utilizes the glutes and hips.

Deep squatting can also strengthen the spine and thereby remedy back pain. With proper form, in the deep squat position, the spine should be straight and aligned with your pelvis. This requires strength and mobility in the lumbar spine to maintain proper alignment. In addition, the spinal strength may lead to improved posture.

A proper deep squat can also strengthen the pelvic floor. A strong pelvic floor can prevent pain, incontinence, and even  organ prolapse.

Being able to deep squat also gives you a resting position. In times when a chair or bench isn't available, one can just go into a deep squat to relax and chill. Though perhaps in Western cultures, you might get a few stares.

One of the less talked about benefits is being able to get to interact with young kids on their level. Instead of bending over or complaining about knee or back pain, you can be comfortable at a deep squat position. It gives the ability to engage at a deeper level in play. In addition, that time spent with a child can double as mobility and flexibility training.
