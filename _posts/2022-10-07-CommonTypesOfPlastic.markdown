Plastic is plastic right? No. It's not that simple. There are hundreds of different kinds of plastic and not all plastic is created equal. Yet, in our daily lives, we often encounter the same common types of plastic.

By understanding the differences in plastics, we are better equipped to understand recycling. We can see which plastics are more recyclable and why others are not. Also by understanding the various properties explains the importance of sorting plastics. 

Additionally, we can have nuisance conversations on which plastics may be more harmful then others. 

Here, we go over three common plastics we are likely to encounter in our daily life

## Polyethylene (PE)
Polyethylene is the most common plastic. It is estimated to account for 31% of all plastics. 

### Chemical structure
The chemical structure for polyethylene consists of carbon and hydrogens

### Polyethylene family
Polyethylene is a family of various types, depending on the density and lateral branches of the polymer chains. Some common types within this family include:
- Ultra High molecular weight (UHMWPE)
- High density (HDPE)
- Medium density (MDPE)
- Linear low density (LLDPE)
- Low density (LDPE)
- Cross-linked (PEX)

### Properties
- Low cost
- Low density
- Chemical resistance
- Minimal moisture absorption
- Food grades available
- Difficult to paint
- Cannot stand temperatures above 80C

### Recycling
The recycling code #2 is for HDPE. And the code #4 is for LDPE. 

Both HDPE and LDPE are able to be maniacally recycled where it's shredded, cleaned, and then turned into pellets. The resulting material is often combined with virgin material to create new products.

### Usages
Some common usages for polyethylene include
- Clear food wrap
- Shopping bags
- Detergent bottles
- Automobile fuel tanks
- Tubes and bottles
- Trash bags
- Agriculture mulch
- Wire and cable insulators
- Toys

## Polypropylene (PP)
Polypropylene is the second most common plastic on the market with estimates putting it at around 20% of all plastic. Polypropylene is often mixed with other materials including glass fiber, elastomers, talc creating new materials with different properties. 

### Chemical Structure
Polypropylene is made from carbon and hydrogen and is a olefin like polyethylene.
### Properties
- Low cost
- Low density
- Chemical resistance
- Minimal moisture absorption
- Food grades available
- Poor UV resistance
- Brittle at low temperatures
- Poor scratch resistance

### Recycling
The recycling code for Polypropylene is #5 or > PP <. Only about 1% of Polypropylene is recycled.  In a mechanical recycle, Polypropylene is collected, sorted, cleaned, shredded and then separated. Then it is recombined and turned into granules to be used in new products

It is also possible to chemically recycle, turning it into raw material known as pyrolysis oil which can then be used to make virgin grade products. 

### Usages
- Disposable cups for hot beverages
- lids on shampoo bottles
- Pill containers
- Syringes
- Food containers and lids
- wall containers like yogurt cups
- automotive parts like bumpers, fender liners, and door trim
- 
## Polyvinylchloride (PVC)
Polyvinylchloride is the thirds most common plastic. Unlike Polypropylene or Polyethylene which are completely derived from oil, PVC contains chlorine which is derived from salt. 

### Chemical Structure
Polyvinylchloride is made up of chains of carbon, hydrogen and chlorine. 

### Properties
- Low cost
- Low density
- Chemical resistance
- Minimal moisture absorption
- Food grades available
- Resistant to microorganism
- Good UV resistance
- Hydrochloric acid is formed during thermal decomposition 

### Recycling
The recycling code for Polyvinylchloride is 3.

It can be recycled through either mechanical or feedstock processes. Once of the issues with recycling Polyvinylchloride mechanically is due to it's high chlorine content. It should only be mixed with other Polyvinylchlorides. In addition, all these polymers have additives and when combined together, make the resulting Polyvinylchloride mix unsuitable for many applications that require more precise properties

### Usages
- Water and sewage pipes
- Flooring
- Siding and window frames
- Wiring and cables
- Medical tubing
- Medical blood collection bags

# Conclusion
Polyethylene, Polypropylene, and Polyvinylchloride are just three of the most common plastics. This guide sought to give a high level overview of these plastics and some of the differences in properties and usages.
